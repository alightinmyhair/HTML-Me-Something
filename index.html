            <h2>The What and Why of Exercising</h2>
            <p><strong>Exercise definition</strong>: putting something into action; bodily or mental exertion; regular or repeated use of of a faculty or bodily organ.</p>
            <p>There are several books, websites and other literature that sing the benefits of exercises. Below are just a few things
                that exercise does for a person and their body:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Makes you feel good (great energy booster!)</li>
                    <li>Keeps you healthy and fights off disease</li>
                    <li>Controls your weight</li>
                </ol>
            <p>The list above is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the benefits of excercising, but there is so much more. 
                I've listed some website below that list discuss even more pros to this activity.</p>
                <ul>

                    <li><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201205/19-reasons-exercise">Psychology Today</a>

                </ul>
            <h2>So How Does One Exactly Exercise?</h2>
            <p>While almost everyone can agree that excercising is beneficial and good for long term health; many people
                get caught up on how they should go about doing the exercise. Is cardio the best method of exercising? Is weightlifting better?
            <p><strong>Putting exercise into action is literally one of the most difficult hurdles to get over.</strong></p>
            <p>You can read all about the reasons that people find it difficult to exercise by going to this website, which accurately sums this up
                rather well. In fact, most likely, one of the reason(s) listed may be relevant to you. <br><a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/370670-ten-reasons-people-do-not-exercise/">Click here to find out why people don't exercise</a></br></p>

            <p>Basically, it is important to remember that you should get, at minumum, the below requirements for exercise a week:
                    <p><br><strong>Aerobic activity:</strong> Get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. The guidelines suggest that you spread out this exercise during the course of a week.</br>
                    <strong>Strength training:</strong> Do strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least two times a week. Aim to do a single set of each exercise, using a weight or resistance level heavy enough to tire your muscles after about 12 to 15 repetitions.</p>
                <br>Please note: The information I just listed was found on Mayo Clinics website, <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916">just click here to read more.</a></br>

            <h2>Finally, Where and When Can You Exercise</h2>
            <p>You can excercise anywhere and at any time. It's best to sit down and figure out a plan for the week, as everyone's schedules are super busy. But if you just plan ahead then you'll start getting the
            full benefits of exercise in almost over night!</p>
